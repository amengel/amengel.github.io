## Free Expression and Constructive Dialogue in the University of North Carolina System

I, along with  [Timothy Ryan](https://timryan.web.unc.edu/), [Jennifer Larson](https://englishcomplit.unc.edu/faculty-directory/jennifer-larson/), and [Mark McNeilly](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/mark-mcneilly/) examined the experiences of undergraduates with free expression and constructive dialogue at eight difference UNC system schools. We received support for this project from the UNC system office. More on the project results and background can be found at the project website: https://fecdsurveyreport.web.unc.edu/
