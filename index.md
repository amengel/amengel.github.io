I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Before this I was a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University's <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/taubman/">Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy</a> and an affiliate with <a href="https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/">The Policy Lab</a>. I received my PhD in political science from Vanderbilt University.<br />  

My research interests primarily focus on the politics of intergroup conflict and cooperation. This includes the origins and implications of individualsâ€™ social identities and intergroup attitudes. To better answer these questions, I also work on issues related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures. Across projects I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches. I have published articles on these topics in venues including the <i>Journal of Politics</i> and <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>. My work has also been covered in outlets including <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>NPR</i>.<br />
