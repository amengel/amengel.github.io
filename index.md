I am a political science Ph.D. candidate at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on political behavior and public opinion in the United States. I am centrally interested in how context and social group orientations shape how people engage politically. I seek to understand how individuals’ group identities and intergroup attitudes shape, and are shaped by, variation in political context. To explore these relationships I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches.<br /> 

In my dissertation project I argue that the political science conventional wisdom on the relationship between Whites’ racial attitudes and politics is incomplete. This position holds that these early-learned racial beliefs consistently explain political views, powerfully shaping partisan loyalties and political decision-making through adulthood. Instead, I flip this view on its head and show that today’s polarized political environment can make Whites’ partisan ties a potent influence on attitudes about race and racial groups. Changes in the political context shift causal dynamics in ways current theorizing ignores.<br />

Methodologically I am interested in questions related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures and I use latent variable models to evaluate and refine measures of attitudes and identities.
