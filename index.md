I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">Stony Brook University</a>. I received my PhD in political science from Vanderbilt University and previously worked at <a href="https://psc.uncg.edu/">UNC-Greensboro</a>.<br />  

Multi-racial liberal democracies like the United States face important challenges in fostering inclusion and addressing group-based inequalities. My research agenda sheds light on these pressing issues by investigating how individuals’ attitudes about social groups–particularly racialized groups–develop and change, and when, why, and among whom they influence opinions. I am interested not only in understanding the origins and implications of exclusionary attitudes, but also how even tolerant individuals do not always embrace policy positions or movements advancing full inclusion. To better answer these questions I also work on issues related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures. Across projects, I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches. I have published articles on these topics in venues including the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, and <i> Perspectives on Politics</i>. My work has also been covered in outlets including <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>NPR</i>.<br />

I was also a co-investigator on the 2021-2022 University of North Carolina System <a href="https://fecdsurveyreport.web.unc.edu/">Free Expression and Constructive Dialogue</a> project.

At times I post [informal writeups](https://www.amengelhardt.com/writing/) on topics related to my research.
