I am a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy. I received my PhD in political science from Vanderbilt University.<br />  

I study the dynamic relationship between politics and individuals’ identities and intergroup attitudes. Political conflict throughout this country’s history has involved the inclusion and exclusion of various groups into the polis. I am interested in understanding how this affects the political relevance of the mass public’s social group attachments and attitudes about these groups, and even if these orientations change in response to political dynamics. To explore these relationships I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches.<br /> 

Across different projects I show that Whites' partisanship leads to changes in attitudes about Black Americans, assess how elite rhetoric shapes the political relevance of individuals' different group identities, highlight how partisan identities condition behavior in a non-political realm, and unpack explanations for racial group divides in attitudes about the criminal justice system. My research agenda speaks to the dynamic relationship between social group orientations and politics, the very things received wisdom argues undergird politics.<br />

Methodologically I am interested in questions related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures and I use latent variable models to evaluate and refine measures of attitudes and identities.
