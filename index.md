I am a post-doctoral research associate affiliated with Brown University's Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy. I received my PhD in political science from Vanderbilt University.<br />  

My research focuses on political behavior and public opinion in the United States. I study the relationship between race and politics to understand how political context affects individuals' identities and intergroup attitudes. Political elites throughout this country's history have varied markedly in how they talk about race and racial groups. I am interested in understanding how this affects the mass public's social group attachments and attitudes about these groups. To explore these relationships I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches.<br /> 

In my dissertation project I argue that the political science conventional wisdom on the relationship between Whites’ racial attitudes and politics is incomplete. This position holds that these early-learned and stable racial beliefs consistently explain political views, powerfully shaping partisan loyalties and political decision-making through adulthood. Instead, I flip this view on its head and show that today’s polarized political environment can make Whites’ partisan ties a potent influence on attitudes about race and racial groups. The dynamic relationship between politics and Whites’ racial views comes from changes in political context that shape how people engage with the information environment, patterns current theorizing ignores.<br />

Methodologically I am interested in questions related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures and I use latent variable models to evaluate and refine measures of attitudes and identities.
