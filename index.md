I am a political science Ph.D. candidate at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on political behavior and public opinion in the United States, addressing how context and social group orientations shape how people engage politically. I seek to understand how individuals’ group identities and intergroup attitudes shape, and are shaped by, variation in political context. To answer these questions I rely on diverse methods, study different populations, and draw from different theoretical approaches. <br />

In my dissertation project I argue that the conventional wisdom in political science, where early-learned racial beliefs consistently explain political views, powerfully shaping partisan loyalties and political decision-making through adulthood, is incomplete. Instead, I show through a mixed-methods approach that today’s polarized political environment can make Whites’ partisan ties a potent influence on attitudes about race and racial groups. Changes in the political context shift causal dynamics in ways current theorizing ignores.<br />

Methodologically I am interested in questions related to linking theoretical constructs with empirical measures and I use latent variable models to evaluate and refine measures of attitudes and identities.
